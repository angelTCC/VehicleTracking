# üöó Vehicle Tracking üõ£Ô∏è

This project leverages a fine-tuned YOLO model for vehicle detection and tracking, enabling 
automated counting of various vehicle types as they cross a designated line using a single camera or 
video feed. By replacing manual tracking methods with advanced computer vision techniques, the system 
provides accurate real-time data on traffic flow, which can be used to inform transportation control 
decisions. This automation enhances efficiency, improves data accuracy, and supports smarter transportation management.

## ‚ú® Features
- **üöô Vehicle Detection**: Detects multiple types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles).
- **üî¢ Vehicle Counting**: Counts vehicles as they cross a specific line in the frame.
- **üìä Classification**: Classifies vehicles into predefined categories.

|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **mAP@50**   | Mean Average Precision at 50% IoU (Intersection over Union); measures detection accuracy with 50% overlap | 60-80% or higher       | Above 80%                         |
| **mAP@50-95**| Mean Average Precision across IoU thresholds from 50% to 95%; assesses accuracy at various overlap levels | Above 50%              | 60-70% or higher                  |
| **Precision**| Ratio of true positives to total positive predictions; indicates accuracy of detections | Above 70%              | 80-90%                            |
| **Recall**   | Ratio of true positives to total actual positives; measures detection coverage | At least 70%           | Above 80%                         |
